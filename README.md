#DNA.py 
takes the command-line argument "python database sequence" where database is a csv file in the same format as DNAdatabase.csv (or you can just use DNAdatabase.csv) and sequence is a text file containing the DNA sequence you want to profile.

#DNA2.py
works the same as DNA.py but uses a more elegant, recursion-based approach to calculate STR lengths starting from a given position in the DNA sequence. 

#DNA3.py
works the same as DNA2.py except it uses a nested hash table/dictionary to store the entirety of the given database at once.

#credit.py 
uses the Luhn algorithm to detect fraud and avoid unnecessarily checking against the company database for every potentially fraudulent credit card number. Also detects common credit card numbers and outputs their company name e.g. AMEX = American Express.

#readability.py 
calculates the Coleman-Liau index of a text to detect its reading level.
